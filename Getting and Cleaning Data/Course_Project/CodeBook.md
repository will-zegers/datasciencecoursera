> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

 
 
> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 
 
 
 
> For each record it is provided:
 
> ======================================
 
 
 
> - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
 
> - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
 
> - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
 
> - Its activity label. 
 
> - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.</p>

<p>The variables contained in this data set are the calculated average mean and standard deviations on Subject-Activity pairs, consisting of 128 observation each. Note this does not include meanFreq measurements seen in frequency domain variables, as these were interpreted to be separate measurements. Furthermore, only variables consisting of *measurements* were considered relevant to this data set and not variables representing means as a result of calculations on these variables (e.g., gravityMean, tBodyAccMean).</p>
